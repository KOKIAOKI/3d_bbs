## 🔍 Quick understanding about 3D-BBS
<img alt="overview" src="figs/overview.jpg" width="50%">

### Task
- 3D global localization for such as robot's initial pose estimation

### Input
  - A single 3D LiDAR scan aligned in the gravity direction by using such as IMU   
  (Although 3D-BBS also performs 6DoF search without gravity aligning, the processing time is more than 10 times longer.)
  - 3D pre-built point cloud map

### Output
- $4\times4$ transformation matrix about coarse sensor pose in map coordinates.

### Main Features 
- **Full search algorithm** based on branch-and-bound (BnB) scan matching
- **Fast processing (latest: about 20 ms ~)** by proposed GPU-accelerated BnB and roto-translational branching
- **No initial pose** (we assume that the roll and pitch angles are roughly estimated by IMU for faster processing)
- **Low voxelmap memory consumption** due to sparse hash map

### Other Features
<details><summary> Click here! </summary><div>

- Optional **Voxelmap pre-construction** and direct read function
- Optional **timeout** function
- **Minimal dependencies** in core source code so that user can **easily integrate** into the other projects
- **Docker support** by @Taeyoung96
- **Test data** is available, allowing evaluation of localization error and processing time.
- **ROS2 implementation example**

## 📣 News
The latest implementation demonstrates faster processing time than our paper. 
Performance on our test data:
- Hierarchical voxelmap construction
  - Paper: 9,272 ms on average
  - **Latest**: 3,494 ms on average
  - **Load saved voxelmaps directly**: 130 ms on average (See [step 5 on this page](./test/test_code.md) to save voxelmaps)
- Global localization
  - Paper: 878 ms on average
  - **Latest**: **189 ms** on average  

The hardware configuration (Intel Core i7-10700K 3.8GHz, 32GB RAM, and NVIDIA GeForce RTX2060) is the same as in the paper.

## 💻 Use 3D-BBS in your cmake project
<details><summary> Click here! </summary><div>

1. Copy `test/cmake` to your project directry
1. Copy description above `# Common include directories` in `test/CMakeLists.txt` to `your CMakeLists.txt`
1. Add either of the following depending on your implementation  
If you use the CPU version, replace `gpu` with `cpu`.
```
find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)
target_include_directories(yours ${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR} ${gpu_bbs3d_LIBRARY})
```
