The latest implementation demonstrates faster processing times than those published in the paper.  
Specifically, when tested in a real environment with the following hardware configuration (Intel Core i7-10700K 3.8GHz, 32GB RAM, and NVIDIA GeForce RTX2060), the processing times are as follows: 
- Preparation
  - Paper: 9,272 ms on average
  - **Latest**: 3494 ms on average
  - **Using saved voxelmap**: 130 ms on average
- Localize
  - Paper: 878 ms on average
  - **Latest**: **189 ms** on average
